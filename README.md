dotfiles
-----------
My simple dotfiles collection to ease setup on a new machine. Primarily for myself, but feel to fork or just have a look around.

1. If its a brand new machine, run `./bootstrap_osx` in order to install things like Homebrew, the latest Ruby etc.
2. Next (or first if you only want the dotfiles), run `./install`

That should be all you need to do!

*NOTE: You might need to set iTerm to report the terminal as xterm-256colors in order to get colors to display correctly (especially in console Vim)*
